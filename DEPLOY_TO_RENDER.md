# Deploy AI Stocks Companion Jobs to Render

This guide will help you deploy the AI Stocks Companion Jobs system to Render as a background worker service.

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Repository**
- Make sure all your Twilio credentials are hardcoded in the files
- Commit and push your changes to GitHub

### 2. **Create Render Account**
- Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
- Sign up or log in with your GitHub account

### 3. **Deploy the Jobs Service**

#### Option A: Using Render Dashboard
1. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Background Worker"**
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `ai-stocks-jobs`
   - **Root Directory**: `jobs`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: Free (or paid if you need more resources)

#### Option B: Using render.yaml (Recommended)
1. The `render.yaml` file is already configured
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect and use the `render.yaml` configuration

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Since we're using hardcoded values, no environment variables are needed. However, if you want to use environment variables instead:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 5. **Deploy**
